                    Laugh Factory History Since 1979 Opening its doors in 1979,
                    the World Famous Laugh Factory has been recognized as "the
                    #1 comedy club in the country" by such high-profile media as
                    USA Today. With southern California locations in Hollywood
                    (its original Sunset Boulevard locale) and Long Beach
                    (opened in 2008), comedy's top stars, as well as today's
                    brightest emerging talent, shine on its legendary stage.
                    Founder Jamie Masada, the driving force behind the Laugh
                    Factory, is revered as a pioneer and innovator and is an
                    iconic name on the comedy scene. He was and continues to be
                    instrumental in launching the careers of many of today's
                    biggest comics. The New York Daily News called him the "Real
                    King of Comedy." His knowledge and expertise have made him
                    the leading authority on all things comedy and his advice is
                    highly regarded by the entertainment industry's top power
                    brokers. </p>
                    <p>Among the comedians who have performed at the club

                    <p>In 2006,
                    the Laugh Factory made headlines when Michael Richards
                    launched into an unfortunate racist outburst toward two
                    African American men heckling him during a routine. In
                    response, the club banned comedians from using the "n-word"
                    in their acts. Less than a month later, the first incident
                    under the new rule occurred with Damon Wayans dropping the
                    word 16 times in a 20 minute set. He was fined $320 ($20 for
                    each offense) and banned from performing at the venue for
                    three months. A former stand up himself, Masada is a
                    sought-after consultant and successful producer of comedy
                    franchises for both film and television. He served as a
                    producer for Damon Wayan's film, Behind the Smile, which was
                    shot on location at the Laugh Factory's Hollywood location,
                    and Disney's RocketMan. Currently in development are the
                    feature films Blackxican, in association with Paul Rodriguez
                    and Paul Mooney, and with Dom Irrera, Goombas of Comedy. </p>

                    <p>
                    Masada created and is the executive producer of Supreme
                    Court of Comedy, a half-hour, unscripted series he developed
                    which is currently entering its fourth season on DirecTV.
                    Filmed at the Hollywood Club, real-life complaints are heard
                    before comedian and "Chief Justice" Dom Irrera, who hands
                    out hilarious (and surprisingly just) rulings. Guest
                    starring as "Court Counselors" is a who's who of today's top
                    comics. 'Chaim Hollywood, which debuted on The Jewish
                    Channel (TJC) in September 2010, is a comedy series
                    showcasing Judaism's top talent with comedy, music, and
                    talk. Currently in development is Laugh Factory Open Mic for
                    DirecTV and GI Comedy Throwdown, a contemporary take on the
                    traditional USO Comedy Specials. Masada was also a casting
                    consultant for Fox's In Living Color, a ground-breaking and
                    sometimes controversial series which showcased African
                    American humor, music, and culture. Masada was instrumental
                    in championing the casting of both Jim Carrey (one of the
                    few white cast members) and Jamie Foxx, not only helping to
                    ensure the success of the show, but fast-tracking the two
                    aspiring, young comedians' careers.</p>
